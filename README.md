# project euler (first 100 problems)

These are my solutions for the first 100 problems of [project euler](https://projecteuler.net) using [Julia](https://julialang.org/).

Please note that project euler states it is okay to share solutions for the first 100 problems, but it's not okay to share solutions for the later problems posted there.

I don't have a mathematical background. All algorithms in this repository are my own, using only standard libraries. Next to each algorithm I'll post the time it took to complete on my server (which is not very potent but suitable for long running tasks)). This time is not reproducible and only gives an indication how efficient or inefficient my algorithm is.

The following statement is taken from the project euler FAQ, 5th of January 2023:

***I learned so much solving problem XXX, so is it okay to publish my solution elsewhere?***

*It appears that you have answered your own question. There is nothing quite like that "Aha!" moment when you finally beat a problem which you have been working on for some time. It is often through the best of intentions in wishing to share our insights so that others can enjoy that moment too. Sadly, that will rarely be the case for your readers. Real learning is an active process and seeing how it is done is a long way from experiencing that epiphany of discovery. Please do not deny others what you have so richly valued yourself.*

*However, the rule about sharing solutions outside of Project Euler does not apply to the first one-hundred problems, as long as any discussion clearly aims to instruct methods, not just provide answers, and does not directly threaten to undermine the enjoyment of solving later problems. Problems 1 to 100 provide a wealth of helpful introductory teaching material and if you are able to respect our requirements, then we give permission for those problems and their solutions to be discussed elsewhere.*
